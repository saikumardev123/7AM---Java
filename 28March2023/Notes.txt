Packages:

A package is a collection of classes and interfaces. 

We create packages to represent a module or a sub module. 


project -> ecommerce 

 user management, product management, order management 


 package -> user management 


 syntax: package  <package_name>


 ex:  package com.tcs.ecommerce.user

In case if we want to create libraries, accordingly the package names
are given. 

ex: java.sql, java.util.....

All the packages will be stored in a jar(java archive) file. 

Structure:  

  JAR File 
  packages

  classes          interfaces


Arrays:

An array is a linear data structure which stores the data in a 
sequential order. 

In Java, we can store only similar type of data. 

In Java, the arrays are static , once an array is created , we cannot 
extend its size. 


public class ArraysDemo {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		int numArr[] = {10,20,30,40,50};
		
		numArr[2] =20;
	
		
		for(int index = 0; index < numArr.length; index++) {
			System.out.println(numArr[index]);
		}
	}
}

Problem Statement:

Remove the duplicates from the array. 

{10,10,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,5,10,2,34,12,33,4}
