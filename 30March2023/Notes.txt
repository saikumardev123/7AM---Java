Exception Handling Hierarchy:

*  Throwable is the super class of all exceptions.

* Throwable class has 2 sub classes. 

 1.Exception 
 2. Error 

 Any error that occurs unders Exception can be handled . However, any 
 exception that occurs under Error class cannot be handled because 
 these type errors cannot / may not be fixed through code. 

 try,catch, finally:

try syntax:

  try{
      // block of code
  }

  Any  risky code that might raise an exception should be kept inside 
  the try block. Whenever an exception occurs in try block, the control 
  looks for catch block. 

  When an exception occurs in try block, the control immediately 
  jumps to catch block. 

  syntax:

  catch(TypeOfException referenceVariable){
     // log the exception 
     // any alternative operation
  }

 catch block should always follow try block and Java does not allow 
 only catch block or try block. it should be  a combination of both. 

 try{
     // code
 }
 catch(TypeOfException referenceVariable){
     // code
 }
Sometimes there could be an error in catch block also or some code that 
is not a part of try block, so there could be some mandatory statements 
need to be executed. So those statements will be put inside finally 
block.
finally block will be executed irrespective of whether an exception 
occured or not. 


public class TryCatchFinallyDemo {
	
	 public static void main(String[] args) {
		 int arr[] = {1,2};
		  try {
			  System.out.println("Opening DB Connection");
			  System.out.println(arr[4]);
		  }
		  catch(Exception exception) {
			  System.out.println(exception);
			  // error Simulation 
			  //System.out.println(arr[9]);
		  }
		  finally {
			  System.out.println("Closing DB Connection");
		  }
		 
		  System.out.println(arr[1]);
		  System.out.println(arr[0]);
		  
		 
	}

}

Creating own Exceptions: 


class PasswordException extends RuntimeException{
     public PasswordException(String errorMessage) {
		// TODO Auto-generated constructor stub
    	 super(errorMessage);
	}
}

public class CustomExceptionDemo {
	public static void main(String[] args) {	
		 String password= "sjbkjs"; 
		 try {
		 if(password.length() < 8) {
			 throw new PasswordException("Password should be atleast 8 chars");
		 }
		 }catch(PasswordException exception) {
			 System.out.println(exception);
		 }
		 
		 System.out.println("username check");
		
	}
}
