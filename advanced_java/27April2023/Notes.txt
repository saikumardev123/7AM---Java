doPut, doDelete: 

As HttpServlet can support doPut, doDelete methods but html form tag supports only 
get and post requests , hence any operation that we want to achieve should be 
either done using get or post methods only. 

Session Management:


Http Protocol does not remember every request information, which means, every time 
a request coming from the client is considered as a new request. 

HttpSession provides a simple way of maintaining a session.
